USER MANUAL

* Section 5.1.3 Extensions to BUGS.  Correct this section, to state that we do not allow expressions as arguments to multivariate distributions.
* Describe new option for RW_block sampler: adaptScaleOnly, default value FALSE
* Describe new option for MCMC suite: burn-in
* Error in Roxygen documentation for MCMCsuite: description of summaryStats argument is truncated by a '%' sign
* Need to clean-up, or really correct, the Roxygen documentation associated with getValues() and setValues() (which have been deprecated), and also for values() (where the documentation makes references to getValues() and setValues() functions)
